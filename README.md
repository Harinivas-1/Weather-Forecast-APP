TASK = 1: “To-DO LIST” Using CSS, HTML, JAVASCRIPT

INTRODUCTION

This documentation presents a guide for a basic web-based to-do list application. The app allows users to manage tasks by adding new tasks, marking them as completed or incomplete, and deleting tasks from the list. The implementation involves HTML for structure, CSS for styling, and JavaScript for dynamic functionality..
Implementation
The implementation of the to-do list app includes:
⦁	HTML Structure: Defines the layout and elements of the web interface, such as input fields, buttons, and task lists.
⦁	CSS Styling: Provides visual styling to enhance the appearance and usability of the app.
⦁	JavaScript Functionality: Implements the logic for adding, completing, and deleting tasks dynamically without page reloads, using localStorage for data persistence
CODE EXPLAINATION
HTML Structure
⦁	The HTML file (index.html) defines the structure of the app's user interface. It includes:
⦁	Input Field: An <input> element where users can enter new tasks.
⦁	Add Task Button: A <button> element that triggers the addition of a new task.
⦁	Task List: An <ul> (unordered list) element (id="taskList") where tasks are displayed as list items (<li>).
CSS Styling
⦁	The CSS file (styles.css) provides styling to enhance the visual appearance and usability of the app. Key CSS styles include:
⦁	Font Styles: Setting the font family (font-family) and text alignment (text-align).
⦁	Input and Button Styling: Styling the input field (input[type="text"]) and button (button) for better visibility and interactivity.
⦁	List Styling: Customizing the appearance of the task list (ul) and list items (li).
JavaScript Functionality
⦁	The JavaScript file (todo.js) contains the logic and functionality of the to-do list app. Key functionalities include:
⦁	Task Management: Adding tasks to the list, marking tasks as completed or incomplete using checkboxes (<input type="checkbox">), and deleting tasks.
⦁	Rendering Tasks: Dynamically rendering tasks on the web page based on the current state of the tasks array.
⦁	Local Storage: Using localStorage to save and retrieve tasks, allowing tasks to persist even after page reloads.
⦁	Event Handling: Managing user interactions (e.g., button clicks, checkbox changes) through event listeners (onclick, onchange).
USAGE
Users interact with the app by:
⦁	Entering a task description in the input field.
⦁	Clicking the "Add Task" button to add the task to the list.
⦁	Checking or unchecking the checkbox next to a task to mark it as completed or incomplete.
⦁	Clicking the "Delete" button next to a task to remove it from the list.
CONCLUSION
In summary, the to-do list app showcases fundamental web development using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript:
⦁	HTML: Sets up the structure of the app.
⦁	CSS: Styles the app for a visually appealing experience.
⦁	JavaScript: Adds interactive features like task management.
This project is a beginner-friendly introduction to building web applications. It covers basic concepts of user interaction and data manipulation. Use it as a starting point to explore and expand your skills in web development!

TASK = 2 : “WEATHER FORECAST APP” Using CSS, HTML, JAVASCRIPT.

INTRODUCTION:
This document presents a guide to building a weather forecasting web application using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. The app will utilize an external weather API to retrieve and display weather data based on user input.
Implementation:
HTML Structure (index.html):
The HTML file defines the structure of our weather app's user interface. It includes:
⦁	Input Field: A text input for users to enter the location (city, zip code, etc.) for which they want to check the weather.
⦁	Button: A button to trigger the weather data retrieval based on user input.
⦁	Weather Display Area: An empty <div> or <p> element where weather information will be displayed dynamically.
CSS Styling (styles.css):
The CSS file styles the elements of our weather app to improve its visual appeal and user experience. Key CSS styles may include:
⦁	Setting background colors, font styles, and layout positioning.
⦁	Styling the input field and button to make them visually prominent.
⦁	Formatting the weather display area to ensure clear presentation of weather information.
JavaScript Functionality (script.js):
The JavaScript file contains the logic and functionality to make our weather app dynamic and interactive. This includes:
⦁	Event Handling: Listening for button clicks to initiate weather data retrieval.
⦁	API Integration: Making requests to a weather API (e.g., OpenWeatherMap) to fetch weather data based on user input.
⦁	DOM Manipulation: Updating the webpage dynamically to display retrieved weather information.
⦁	Error Handling: Managing error scenarios, such as invalid input or failed API requests.
USAGE
Users can interact with the weather app by:
1. Entering a location (e.g., city name, zip code) into the input field.
2. Clicking the button to fetch and display the current weather for the specified location.
The app will respond by updating the displayed weather information based on the user's input.
CONCLUSION
In conclusion, this weather forecasting app provides a practical example of utilizing web technologies to create an interactive and useful application. By integrating HTML, CSS, and JavaScript along with an external weather API, developers can build a functional weather app that retrieves and displays real-time weather data based on user input. This project serves as a starting point for exploring web development, API integration, and dynamic content rendering. Further enhancements could include additional features like displaying weather forecasts for multiple days, incorporating geolocation for automatic location detection, or styling improvements for a more polished user interface. Use this project as a foundation to expand your skills and create personalized weather applications tailored to specific needs and preferences.
